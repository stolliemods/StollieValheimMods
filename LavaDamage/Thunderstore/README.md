## Description

Don't like instant death due to Lava? Me either.

This mod allows you to change Player Lava Damage taken. Value can be dynamically changed in Config Manager.

Good values that allow you some escape time seem to be either 10 or 20. The damage is applied every 0.2s in the vanilla code from what I can tell so even with those lower values you will die pretty quickly if you dont get out of the lava!
